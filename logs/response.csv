question,answer
"What is the Internet?","A vast, interconnected network of networks that allows devices to communicate and share information globally."
"What is the standardized protocol suite used by the Internet?","TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)."
"What are the small units of data used to transmit information over the Internet?","Packets."
"What are the two primary components of a data packet?","Payload (actual data) and headers (control information)."
"What information is typically contained in a packet header?","Source and destination IP addresses."
"What is the primary function of the Internet Protocol (IP)?","It handles addressing and routing to ensure packets reach the correct endpoint."
"What is the primary function of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?","It ensures reliable data transmission, manages data flow, and performs error checking."
"What are the three steps of the TCP handshake?","SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK."
"How does TCP handle lost or out-of-order packets?","It performs retransmission and reordering."
"What specialized devices direct packets across networks?","Routers."
"What do routers use to determine the best path for a packet?","Routing tables."
"Name two common routing protocols used by routers.","OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)."
"What is an IP address?","A unique identifier assigned to every device on the Internet."
"How many bits are used in an IPv4 address?","32 bits."
"How many bits are used in an IPv6 address?","128 bits."
"What is the purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation)?","It maps internal private IP addresses to public ones to manage IPv4 scarcity."
"What does DNS stand for?","Domain Name System."
"What is the function of the Domain Name System (DNS)?","It translates human-readable domain names into numeric IP addresses."
"What are IXPs?","Internet Exchange Points, where ISPs interconnect to route traffic globally."
"What protocol is used to request and transfer web content?","HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS."
"What is the role of TLS (Transport Layer Security)?","It encrypts data during transmission to ensure confidentiality and integrity."
"What are three examples of network security mechanisms?","Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control mechanisms."
"What are the physical mediums for Internet data travel?","Fiber optic cables, copper wires, and wireless links."
"What is the relationship between IP and TCP in the protocol stack?","TCP sits above IP and provides reliability to the addressing/routing provided by IP."
